PHONE
***********


The phone comand takes any number of alphanumeric arguments and returns 
the first ten digits as a phone number

It checks if has at least 10 digits. It can have as many letters as it 
wants, as the program is only concerned with the digits.

If an argument has less than 10 digits, it lets you know and then 
terminates

If more than 10, it ignores every digit after the tenth digit


***********
DEATER
***********

This program takes any number of alphanumeric arguments. It then sifts 
through all of the arguments looking for either a digit or a string.

It then adds all of the digits together. Finally, it siftsthrough the 
string arguments and checks if the current string is a substring of a 
future string.

NOTES
***********

The gitlog.txt exists because I was saving and updating the function 
files to the wrong directory. So, I saved the log and placed it here to 
show my progress
