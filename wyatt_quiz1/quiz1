I am new to CS. I mostly just tooled around with Linux (Ubuntu). I am super
interested in information security and hope to land a job in that field. 
I have some experience with Kali Linux, which is super fun. I have  experience
in javascript, CSS,  HTML5,  C++ and bash. I have taken 1250, 2250, and am 
currently enrolled in 2261, 2700, and 2750. Also, if you know a way for a poor
student to get access to free PDFs of the requried text, that student would 
be really happy.
